    <h2> Our Mission Statement</h2>
    <p>Our goal is to help beginners in coding become proficient in Java. Our easy-to-understand approach helps students with little knowledge of computer science to learn a standardized language. All these students need is an understanding of Scratch blocks to introduce them to Java. Our approach is very simple. On our varied tabs, we provide a Scratch block and its respective meaning in Java. We have multiple tabs for different levels, so you can learn Java no matter your proficiency; Beginner, Intermediate, and Beyond Scratch. The beginner tab includes simple blocks like “my variable” or “Say Hello”, which translate to basic Java commands such as creating a variable and print statements. The intermediate tab contains more advanced blocks, and the Beyond Scratch tab teaches students about concepts not available in Scratch, such as arrays and math functions. Learn Java with Scratch is a website that can teach a student the basics of an entire language.</p>
