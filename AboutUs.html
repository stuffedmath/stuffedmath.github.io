    <h1> About Us </h1>
    <p>We are 3 middle schoolers from Ashburn, VA. We are passionate about coding and came to this hackathon to learn, experience new things, and meet with like-minded students. Some of our hobbies are competitive math, going outside, and playing video games. In elementary school, we did a program called Hour of Code. Our peers and us learned how to do block coding, but although everyone knew how to code, nobody decided to pursue it further. Since many students can use block coding, Java from Scratch provides an incomparable resource for novice coders.
